# MET MUSEUM VIRTUAL ART TOUR


In this project, I have created virtual experience for the user to look at the 
exhibits that are on display at the Metropolitan Museum by using the [MET API](https://metmuseum.github.io/ "Met API").

When it is available, the following is displayed:

* An image of the object
* The artist name
* The name of the object
* The year the object was made
* The culture from which it came
* The city it was made in
* The country it came from
